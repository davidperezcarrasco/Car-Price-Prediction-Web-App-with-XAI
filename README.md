# Car-Price-Prediction-Web-App-with-XAI
This project creates a Streamlit app for predicting used car prices. It analyzes historical car data and builds a machine learning model to estimate a carâ€™s value. The app incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) to explain key price-influencing factors, providing users with clear insights into the predicted prices.
